## Relevance

The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices into social networks, forming the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), presents unprecedented opportunities for enhancing device interaction and automating decision-making processes. However, the inherent challenges of trustworthiness and security within such a distributed network remain significant hurdles. One key isssue is the accurate definiton of IoT device that prevents to standardise trust models by having an comprehensive contextual device description.

## Solution: Smart Application Reference Ontology for Trust Agents

The SAREF-TA ontology aims to provide a comprehensive semantic framework to facilitate the definition of SIoT devices by detailing concepts related to tasks, devices, measurements, properties, profiles, network packets, and trust indicators. It enables trust models to use this framework as a specification of an SIoT device by leveraging context-aware features for trust recommendations.
